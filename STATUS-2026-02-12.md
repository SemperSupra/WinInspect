# Project Status: 2026-02-12 (Updated)

## Current Status: "Canonical WBAB Integration"
We have successfully transitioned the build system from local host-based compilation to a professional, containerized **WBAB Lifecycle** using canonical images from GHCR.

### Major Achievements (Post-v1.1.0):
- **Containerized Lifecycle:**
    - `winbuild-build.sh`: Now pulls `ghcr.io/sempersupra/winebotappbuilder-winbuild` to build Win32 binaries and the Portable CLI.
    - `package-nsis.sh`: Now pulls `ghcr.io/sempersupra/winebotappbuilder-packager` to generate the Windows Installer.
    - `sign-dev.sh`: Now pulls `ghcr.io/sempersupra/winebotappbuilder-signer` for future binary signing.
- **Improved Build Robustness:**
    - Implemented `find_and_cp` in build scripts to correctly locate binaries regardless of CMake generator layout (Release/ vs root).
    - Unified `tools/wbab` to ensure local development perfectly matches the GitHub Actions environment.
- **Sync Status:** Local `workspace` is fully synced with `SemperSupra/WinInspect` on GitHub.

## Session Relevant Items (Pick-up Notes)
- **Pending Verification:** The local `wbab build` was paused while images were being made public on GHCR. **Immediate next step is to retry the local build.**
- **Handshake Logic:** The Go Portable CLI (`clients/portable/main.go`) still uses a stub for the Ed25519 signature. This needs to be implemented to match the C++ side's strict verification.
- **Docker Dependency:** The build system now requires Docker/Podman to be running on the host to execute the lifecycle.

## Next Steps
1.  **Verify GHCR Access:** Run `./tools/wbab build` to confirm the public availability of the WBAB images.
2.  **Portable CLI Finalization:** Implement real Ed25519 signing in the Go client using `crypto/ed25519`.
3.  **GUI Hierarchy Extension:** Update the `ViewModel` and `WinInspectWindow` to support recursive window enumeration (child windows).
4.  **E2E Smoke Test:** Utilize the `scripts/e2e-smoke.sh` within the container environment to verify the Daemon-CLI-GUI loop.
