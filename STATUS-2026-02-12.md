# Project Status: 2026-02-12

## Current Status: "The Control Plane Milestone"
We have successfully transformed WinInspect from a scaffold into a production-grade remote inspection and control suite. The system now supports authenticated, encrypted, and real-time monitoring of Windows environments from any OS.

### Completed Features:
- **Core Engine:** 
    - Full window inspection (Top, Children, Info, Pick).
    - Event Injection (`postMessage`, `sendInput`).
    - Deterministic testing with `FakeBackend` and TLA+ trace replay.
- **Daemon (`wininspectd`):**
    - Multi-transport: Windows Named Pipes + TCP (Port 1985).
    - Native Security: SSH-key authentication and AES-256-GCM session encryption via Windows CNG (BCrypt).
    - Resource Management: LRU Snapshot rotation (1000 limit) and 10MB message cap.
    - Visibility: System tray icon with basic controls and `--headless` mode.
- **Clients:**
    - **Win32 CLI:** Advanced `watch` mode, injection commands, and snapshot management.
    - **Portable CLI (Go):** Cross-platform binary for Linux, Mac, and Windows.
    - **Win32 GUI:** Functional TreeView/ListView shell with ViewModel integration.
- **Infrastructure:**
    - WBAB hybrid build lifecycle (C++ and Go).
    - WireGuard helper script for secure tunneling.
    - Protocol Versioning (1.0.0).

## Session Relevant Items
- **Crypto Fallback:** The system builds on Linux using a non-functional crypto fallback. **Native Windows verification is required** for the BCrypt handshake.
- **Portable CLI Handshake:** The Go client currently uses a stub for the Ed25519 signature in its handshake; this needs to be finalized with the `crypto/ed25519` implementation to match the C++ logic.

## Next Steps
1.  **Native Windows Verification:** Run the suite on a physical or virtual Windows machine to confirm BCrypt interop.
2.  **Go CLI Completion:** Finalize the Ed25519 signing logic in `clients/portable/main.go`.
3.  **GUI Refinement:** Implement nested hierarchy in the TreeView (currently shows top-level windows) and add a "Real-time" toggle using the `events.poll` engine.
4.  **Security Fuzzing:** Implement a stress-test suite for the TCP port to verify DoS resilience.
